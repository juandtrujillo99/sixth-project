Here, I made a newspapper's index. 
Teacher told me that the objective was create the principal page of a newspapper called "Puerto Escondido" and this it was the result.
I learned to use bootstrap's grid and I meet a SliderMaker tool to make Sliders too much easy and automatic.
However, I am not very sure to use this app in the future, because, I think that it make my website more slow.
What do you think? How do you do your sliders?
